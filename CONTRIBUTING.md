# Contributing to the Project

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the project. Please follow these guidelines to ensure that your contributions adhere to security best practices and maintain the integrity of the codebase.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone via SSH**: Always clone the repository using SSH instead of HTTPS for better security.  
   Reference: [GitHub Docs on SSH Key Generation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Ensure that your environment is configured securely. Use environment variables for sensitive data, and do not hardcode secrets into the code.
   - Reference: [Best Practices for Secrets Management](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

4. **Create a Feature Branch**: Work on your feature or bug fix in a separate branch from `main` (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name`).

5. **Sign Your Commits**: Ensure that all commits are signed to verify their authenticity.  
   Reference: [Signing Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

6. **Run Static Code Analysis**: Use linters like Black, Ruff, or Flake8 to ensure code quality and identify potential issues before submitting a pull request.
   Reference: [Using Python Linters](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Secure Development Guidelines

- **Branch Protection**: Submit all changes via a pull request. Ensure that your pull request adheres to branch protection rules and undergoes a code review before being merged.
- **Secrets Management**: Do not commit any sensitive information such as API keys or credentials. Use `.gitignore` and secure environment variable handling.
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Contributors must have 2FA enabled on their GitHub accounts.  
   Reference: [GitHub Docs on 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication).

- **Test Your Changes**: Add unit or integration tests to validate your codeâ€™s functionality and security. Bonus points are awarded for high test coverage.

## Code Review and Merging

1. **Pull Requests**: Submit your changes via a pull request. Each pull request must:
   - Be reviewed by at least one maintainer.
   - Pass all existing tests and linting checks.
   - Follow the security practices outlined in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
   
2. **Code Review**: A code review will check for security vulnerabilities, correctness, and adherence to the OWASP Top 10 security principles.
